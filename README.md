# WebDevBootcamp

This project was built as part of Colt Steele’s Web Developer Bootcamp course, which I followed in 2021 during my personal time to gain hands-on experience with full-stack web development.

### What It Includes:
- Node.js + Express backend with routing and middleware
- EJS templating for dynamic frontend rendering
- MongoDB integration for data persistence
- RESTful routes and CRUD operations

### Why I Built It:
Although my primary focus is in QA automation, I wanted to deepen my understanding of the full development lifecycle. Working through this course helped me:
- Understand how developers think and build
- Gain insight into how frontends and APIs work behind the scenes
- Improve the relevance and depth of the tests I write professionally

### Status:
Archived — last updated in 2021, but kept public to reflect the time and intention I invested in expanding my technical breadth.
